# Android-MVVM
A sample app to demonstrate MVVM architecture with Android.

The app fetches the public repositories using the Github api and shows the following details in the endless-recyclerview.
- repo name
- description
- login of the owner

The results from the api are paginated i.e. 10 results at a time and are stored in the persistent storage.
